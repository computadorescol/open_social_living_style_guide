note:

This does not work without additional set up. At the moment, it is a nice place to keep code snippets for a blog.



note to self: 

1. instructions and link to blog

2. list resources



Troubleshooting

1. Not sure why the package isn't being replaced correctly. You'll 
notice the function folder isn't present. I clones it directly 
from here instead https://github
.com/goalgorilla/twig-drupal-filters

2. Understand what is compiling, and to where. If something isn't 
displaying as expected, look for its absence to start ruling out factors in 
the render process.
